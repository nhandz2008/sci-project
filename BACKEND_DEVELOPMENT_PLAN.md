# SCI Backend Development Plan

This document provides a high-level, sequential plan for developing the backend of the Science Competitions Insight (SCI) project. Follow these steps in order to ensure a smooth, dependency-free development process from the current setup to a fully functional, well-tested backend.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Project Structure

1. **Review and Finalize Project Structure** ✅
   - ✅ Audit the backend directory for required folders and files.
   - ✅ Align structure with best practices (see SCI_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md).
   - ✅ Remove or reorganize any legacy or unnecessary files.
   - ✅ Ensure Docker, environment, and dependency setup is complete.

2. **Configure Database** ✅
   - ✅ Double-check `.env` for correct PostgreSQL settings.
   - ✅ Test database connectivity using a simple script or CLI tool.
   - ✅ Set up Alembic for migrations if not already done.

3. **Implement Base Models** ✅
   - ✅ Define `User` and `Competition` models in the models directory.
   - ✅ Establish relationships (User has many Competitions).
   - ✅ Create and run initial Alembic migration to generate tables.
   - ✅ Verify tables are created in the database.

4. **Set Up Core Utilities** ✅
   - ✅ Implement database session management (dependency injection).
   - ✅ Add password hashing and JWT utility functions.
   - ✅ Configure CORS and environment-based settings in FastAPI.
   - ✅ Test that the app starts and connects to the database without errors.

**Phase 1 Status: COMPLETED** ✅

   - ❌ Enforce role-based access control (CREATOR, ADMIN) on endpoints.
   - ❌ Use Pydantic models for all request/response validation.

3. **Testing Authentication & User Management** ❌
   - ❌ Write unit tests for authentication logic (token creation, password hashing).
   - ❌ Write integration tests for all user-related endpoints.
   - ❌ Test edge cases: invalid credentials, duplicate users, unauthorized access, etc.

**Phase 2 Status: NOT STARTED** ❌

---

## Phase 3: Competition Management

1. **CRUD Endpoints for Competitions** ❌
   - ❌ Implement endpoint to create a competition (authenticated users).
   - ❌ Add endpoint to list competitions with filtering, pagination, and search.
   - ❌ Implement endpoint to retrieve competition details by ID.
   - ❌ Add endpoints to update and delete competitions (owner/admin only).
   - ❌ Enforce permissions for modification/deletion.

2. **Content Moderation Workflow** ❌
   - ❌ Add status fields to Competition model (pending, approved, rejected).
   - ❌ Implement endpoints for admin to review, approve, or reject competitions.
   - ❌ Add moderation logic to ensure only approved competitions are public.
   - ❌ Notify creators of approval/rejection (log or email).

3. **Testing Competition Management** ❌
   - ❌ Write tests for all competition endpoints (CRUD, moderation).
   - ❌ Test permissions, filtering, pagination, and search.
   - ❌ Cover edge cases: unauthorized access, invalid data, etc.

**Phase 3 Status: NOT STARTED** ❌

---

## Phase 4: File Upload & Media Management

1. **Integrate AWS S3 for Image Storage** ❌
   - ❌ Add S3 credentials and bucket info to `.env` and config.
   - ❌ Implement utility for uploading and deleting images from S3.
   - ❌ Add endpoints for image upload, deletion, and status checking.
   - ❌ Validate file type, size, and security on upload.
   - ❌ Link uploaded images to competitions in the database.

2. **Testing File Uploads** ❌
   - ❌ Write tests for image upload and deletion endpoints.
   - ❌ Test with valid and invalid file types/sizes.
   - ❌ Test error handling for failed uploads/deletions.

**Phase 4 Status: NOT STARTED** ❌

---

## Phase 5: Recommendations & Advanced Features

1. **Implement Recommendation Endpoint** ❌
   - ❌ Design input schema for recommendation requests.
   - ❌ Integrate with LLM API for generating recommendations.
   - ❌ Implement endpoint to receive user input and return recommended competitions.
   - ❌ Validate and sanitize all input data.

2. **Testing Recommendations** ❌
   - ❌ Write tests for recommendation endpoint and LLM integration.
   - ❌ Test with various user profiles and scenarios.
   - ❌ Handle and test LLM API errors gracefully.

**Phase 5 Status: NOT STARTED** ❌

---

## Phase 6: Admin & Analytics

1. **Admin Endpoints** ❌
   - ❌ Implement endpoint to list pending competitions for review.
   - ❌ Add endpoints for approving/rejecting competitions.
   - ❌ Implement analytics endpoints (competition stats, user engagement, etc.).
   - ❌ Add endpoints for user management (list, delete, change role).

2. **Analytics & Monitoring** ❌
   - ❌ Integrate logging and error monitoring (e.g., Sentry).
   - ❌ Add endpoints for platform analytics and reporting.
   - ❌ Ensure analytics endpoints are admin-only.

3. **Testing Admin & Analytics** ❌
   - ❌ Write tests for all admin and analytics endpoints.
   - ❌ Test permissions and data accuracy.
   - ❌ Simulate analytics/reporting scenarios in tests.

**Phase 6 Status: NOT STARTED** ❌

## Phase 7: System Endpoints & Finalization

1. **System Endpoints** ✅
   - ✅ Implement `/health` and `/info` endpoints.
   - ❌ Ensure OpenAPI docs are complete and accurate.
   - ❌ Add versioning and metadata to API responses.

2. **Comprehensive Testing** ❌
   - ❌ Write end-to-end tests for all major user flows.
   - ❌ Test error handling, edge cases, and security vulnerabilities.
   - ❌ Run full test suite and fix any failing tests.

3. **Documentation & Cleanup** ❌
   - ❌ Update README and API documentation with usage examples.
   - ❌ Clean up codebase, remove unused files, and ensure consistency.
   - ❌ Review and refactor code for maintainability and clarity.

**Phase 7 Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETED** ⚠️

## Ongoing: Best Practices

- Use Pydantic models for all input/output validation.
- Write tests for every new feature and endpoint.
- Use async functions for all I/O-bound operations.
- Handle errors and edge cases early in each function.
- Keep code modular, DRY, and well-documented.
- Regularly review and update dependencies for security.
