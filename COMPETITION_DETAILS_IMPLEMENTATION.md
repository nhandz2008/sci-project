  title: string;
  description?: string;
  competition_link?: string;
  image_url?: string;
  location?: string;
  format?: 'online' | 'offline' | 'hybrid';
  scale?: 'provincial' | 'regional' | 'international';
  registration_deadline?: string;
  target_age_min?: number;
  target_age_max?: number;
  is_active: boolean;
  is_featured: boolean;
  owner_id: string;
}
```

### API Endpoints Used
