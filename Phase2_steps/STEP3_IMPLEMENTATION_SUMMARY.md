   - Partial updates supported
   - UUID validation

5. ✅ `DELETE /competitions/{id}` - Delete competition (owner/admin only)
   - Permission validation
   - UUID validation
   - Proper error handling

6. ✅ `GET /competitions/my/competitions` - Get user's competitions
   - Shows all user's competitions (approved and pending)
   - Pagination support

#### Security Features:
- ✅ Owner-based access control
- ✅ Admin override capabilities
- ✅ Public filtering (approved only)
- ✅ UUID validation
- ✅ Proper error handling

### Phase 4: Admin Moderation Routes ✅
**Created `app/api/routes/admin.py` with 3 endpoints:**

#### Admin Moderation Endpoints:
1. ✅ `GET /admin/competitions/pending` - List pending competitions (admin only)
   - Admin authentication required
   - Pagination support
   - Shows competitions awaiting approval

2. ✅ `PUT /admin/competitions/{id}/approve` - Approve competition (admin only)
   - Admin authentication required
   - UUID validation
   - Updates approval status

3. ✅ `PUT /admin/competitions/{id}/reject` - Reject competition (admin only)
   - Admin authentication required
   - UUID validation
   - Updates approval status

#### Security Features:
- ✅ Admin-only access control
- ✅ UUID validation
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Moderation workflow support

### Phase 5: Router Structure ✅
**Updated `app/api/main.py` to include all routes:**

#### Router Organization:
- ✅ `auth.router` - Authentication endpoints
- ✅ `users.router` - User management endpoints
- ✅ `competitions.router` - Competition management endpoints
- ✅ `admin.router` - Admin moderation endpoints

#### API Structure:
```
/api/v1/
├── /auth/ (5 endpoints)
├── /users/ (8 endpoints)
├── /competitions/ (6 endpoints)
└── /admin/ (3 endpoints)
```
