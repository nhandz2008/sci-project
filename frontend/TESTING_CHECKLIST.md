# Competition Management System - Manual Testing Checklist

## üöÄ Quick Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Start Backend Server
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd /home/vietnq/Projects/SCI/sci-project/backend

# Start FastAPI server
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
**Expected output**: `INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000`

### Step 2: Start Frontend Server
```bash
# Open new terminal and navigate to frontend directory
cd /home/vietnq/Projects/SCI/sci-project/frontend

# Start React development server
npm run dev
```
**Expected output**: 
```
  VITE v5.4.19  ready in 284 ms
  ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:3001/
  ‚ûú  Network: http://192.168.5.105:3001/
