# SCI Backend Development Plan

This document provides a high-level, sequential plan for developing the backend of the Science Competitions Insight (SCI) project. Follow these steps in order to ensure a smooth, dependency-free development process from the current setup to a fully functional, well-tested backend.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Project Structure

1. **Review and Finalize Project Structure** ✅
   - ✅ Audit the backend directory for required folders and files.
   - ✅ Align structure with best practices (see SCI_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md).
   - ✅ Remove or reorganize any legacy or unnecessary files.
   - ✅ Ensure Docker, environment, and dependency setup is complete.

2. **Configure Database** ✅
   - ✅ Double-check `.env` for correct PostgreSQL settings.
   - ✅ Test database connectivity using a simple script or CLI tool.
   - ✅ Set up Alembic for migrations if not already done.

3. **Implement Base Models** ✅
   - ✅ Define `User` and `Competition` models in the models directory.
   - ✅ Establish relationships (User has many Competitions).
   - ✅ Create and run initial Alembic migration to generate tables.
   - ✅ Verify tables are created in the database.

4. **Set Up Core Utilities** ✅
   - ✅ Implement database session management (dependency injection).
   - ✅ Add password hashing and JWT utility functions.
   - ✅ Configure CORS and environment-based settings in FastAPI.
   - ✅ Test that the app starts and connects to the database without errors.

**Phase 1 Status: COMPLETED** ✅

---

## Phase 2: Authentication & User Management

1. **Implement Authentication System** ✅
   - ✅ Set up OAuth2 password flow with FastAPI dependencies.
   - ✅ Implement JWT token creation and validation logic.
   - ✅ Add endpoints for user registration, login, and password reset.
   - ✅ Secure endpoints with authentication dependencies.

2. **User Management Endpoints** ✅
   - ✅ Add endpoint for retrieving current user profile.
   - ✅ Implement endpoint for updating user profile and changing password.
   - ✅ Add admin-only endpoints for listing and deleting users.
   - ✅ Enforce role-based access control (CREATOR, ADMIN) on endpoints.
   - ✅ Use Pydantic models for all request/response validation.

3. **Testing Authentication & User Management** ✅
   - ✅ Write unit tests for authentication logic (token creation, password hashing).
   - ✅ Write integration tests for all user-related endpoints.
   - ✅ Test edge cases: invalid credentials, duplicate users, unauthorized access, etc.

**Phase 2 Status: COMPLETED** ✅

---

## Phase 3: Competition Management

1. CRUD Endpoints for Competitions ✅/➕
   - ✅ Public listing and detail (approved only):
     - `GET /competitions` with pagination, search, filters (format, scale, location)
     - `GET /competitions/{id}` returns details if `is_approved=True`
   - ✅ Authenticated creator/admin actions:
     - `POST /competitions` create competition (owner = current user; `is_approved=False` by default)
     - `PUT /competitions/{id}` update competition (owner/admin only)
     - `DELETE /competitions/{id}` delete competition (owner/admin only)
     - `GET /competitions/my/competitions` list current user’s competitions
   - ➕ Enhancements to implement:
     - Add `GET /competitions/featured` to list featured, approved competitions
     - Add sorting (`sort_by=created_at|registration_deadline|title`, `order=asc|desc`)
     - Validate and normalize `location` (trim, case-insensitive search), ensure SQLite/Postgres compatibility for search
     - Enforce a max `limit` of 1000 consistently via schema (already applied)

2. Content Moderation Workflow ✅/➕
   - ✅ Admin moderation endpoints:
     - `GET /admin/competitions/pending` — list pending (to be adjusted; see below)
     - `PUT /admin/competitions/{id}/approve`
     - `PUT /admin/competitions/{id}/reject`
   - ➕ Adjustments:
     - Pending definition: update `get_pending_competitions` to use `is_approved=False` for newly created competitions (currently checks `is_approved IS NULL`)
     - Add moderation audit fields on `Competition` (optional): `approved_by`, `approved_at`, `rejection_reason`
     - Ensure public endpoints only show `is_approved=True`; creators can view their own regardless of approval

3. Schemas & Validation ✅/➕
   - ✅ Request models: `CompetitionCreate`, `CompetitionUpdate` with validators:
     - `registration_deadline` must be in the future
     - `target_age_max > target_age_min` when both provided
     - `detail_image_urls` handled as list in schema and stored as JSON string in model
   - ✅ Response models: `CompetitionResponse`, `CompetitionListResponse`, `CompetitionListPaginatedResponse`, moderation responses
   - ➕ Add `CompetitionSearchParams` (alias of existing filter params) with `sort_by`, `order`
   - ➕ Add strict URL validation for `competition_link`, image URLs (length and basic format)

4. Permissions & Security ✅
   - Admin can modify/delete any competition
   - Owner can modify/delete only own competition (`can_modify_competition`, `can_delete_competition`)
   - Public can only see approved competitions; authenticated users see their own

5. Business Rules ✅/➕
   - ✅ Creation defaults: `is_active=True`, `is_featured=False`, `is_approved=False`
   - ✅ Update supports partial fields; image list merged via setter
   - ➕ Prevent updates that set past `registration_deadline`
   - ➕ Optional toggle endpoints (admin only): feature/unfeature, activate/deactivate

6. Testing Plan (to expand) ➕
   - Unit tests (CRUD):
     - Create/read/update/delete competition
     - Filters: `format`, `scale`, `location`, `is_approved`, `is_featured`, `owner_id`
     - Search behavior (case-insensitive; SQLite vs Postgres)
     - Pagination and total counts
     - Permission checks for owner vs admin on update/delete
   - Route tests:
     - Public list shows only approved; detail returns 404 for unapproved
     - Creator create/update/delete and list their competitions
     - Admin can update/delete any; can approve/reject; pending list correctness
     - New: featured listing and sorting combinations
   - Moderation tests:
     - Approve/reject transitions; public visibility toggling
     - Optional audit fields (if implemented)
   - Edge cases:
     - Invalid UUIDs, empty/overlong titles, invalid URLs
     - Past `registration_deadline` on create/update (reject)
     - Large `detail_image_urls` arrays and JSON serialization

7. Implementation Tasks (ordered) ➕
   - [ ] Update `get_pending_competitions` to treat `is_approved=False` as pending (or introduce `approval_status` enum)
   - [ ] Add sorting params to `get_competitions` and surface in `/competitions`
   - [ ] Add `GET /competitions/featured` (approved + featured)
   - [ ] Strengthen URL validation for `competition_link` and images in schemas
   - [ ] Enforce future `registration_deadline` in update path
   - [ ] Optional: add `approved_by`, `approved_at`, `rejection_reason` fields; persist in moderation endpoints
   - [ ] Optional admin endpoints: `PUT /admin/competitions/{id}/feature`, `PUT /admin/competitions/{id}/unfeature`
   - [ ] Add comprehensive tests covering all above

**Phase 3 Status: IN PROGRESS (core CRUD and moderation endpoints exist; enhancements and robustness improvements pending)**

## Phase 4: File Upload & Media Management

1. **Integrate AWS S3 for Image Storage** ❌
   - ❌ Add S3 credentials and bucket info to `.env` and config.
   - ❌ Implement utility for uploading and deleting images from S3.

2. **Analytics & Monitoring** ❌
   - ❌ Integrate logging and error monitoring (e.g., Sentry).
   - ❌ Add endpoints for platform analytics and reporting.
   - ❌ Ensure analytics endpoints are admin-only.

3. **Testing Admin & Analytics** ❌
   - ❌ Write tests for all admin and analytics endpoints.
   - ❌ Test permissions and data accuracy.
   - ❌ Simulate analytics/reporting scenarios in tests.

1. **System Endpoints** ✅
   - ✅ Implement `/health` and `/info` endpoints.
   - ❌ Ensure OpenAPI docs are complete and accurate.
   - ❌ Add versioning and metadata to API responses.

2. **Comprehensive Testing** ❌

## Ongoing: Best Practices

- Use Pydantic models for all input/output validation.
- Write tests for every new feature and endpoint.
- Use async functions for all I/O-bound operations.
- Handle errors and edge cases early in each function.
- Keep code modular, DRY, and well-documented.
- Regularly review and update dependencies for security.
